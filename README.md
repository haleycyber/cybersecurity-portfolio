# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Haley Thomas

🎯 This is a collection of cybersecurity projects focused on human-centered security, behavioral risk, and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance). These projects reflect my transition from psychology and behavioral health into cybersecurity — where I combine technical awareness with insight into human behavior.
