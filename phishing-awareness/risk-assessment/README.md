# Risk Assessment Project ‚Äì Small Clinic or School

This project presents a **human-centered cybersecurity risk assessment** for a fictional small clinic or K-12 school. The goal is to identify common threats, assess their likelihood and impact, and provide mitigation strategies ‚Äî especially around human behavior and system access.

## üè• Scenario: Small Health Clinic or Educational Institution

- Staff: ~25 employees
- Data: Student or patient records, internal communication, EMR system access
- Infrastructure: Basic local servers, Wi-Fi network, shared workstations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Summary Table

| Risk # | Threat                           | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------|------------|------------|
| 1      | Phishing attack on staff email  | High   | High       | Staff training; email filtering |
| 2      | Shared login credentials        | Medium | High       | Role-based access control |
| 3      | Unsecured Wi-Fi                 | High   | Medium     | WPA3, network segmentation |
| 4      | Lost or stolen devices          | High   | Medium     | Device encryption, lock screens |
| 5      | Weak passwords                  | Medium | High       | Enforce strong password policies |
| 6      | Lack of software updates        | High   | Medium     | Automated patching policy |
| 7      | Insider threat (disgruntled staff) | High | Low        | Access monitoring, HR protocols |

## üéØ Objectives

- Practice applying risk frameworks (e.g., NIST)
- Blend behavioral insight with technical security
- Highlight simple yet effective mitigation strategies

---

## üß† Behavioral Lens

This risk assessment considers not only the technical side of threats, but also the **human factors** behind them:
- Why users click phishing emails
- Why password fatigue happens
- How stress and burnout increase insider threats

---

## üîß Skills Demonstrated

- Risk analysis and prioritization
- Behavior-based threat modeling
- Compliance-aware mitigation planning
- Communication of risk in plain language

---

## üìÑ Files Included

- `risk_assessment_report.pdf` ‚Äì A formatted PDF of the report
- `risk_matrix.png` ‚Äì Optional visual matrix of impact vs. likelihood
- `behavioral_notes.docx` ‚Äì Psychology applied to risk behaviors

---

## ‚úÖ Future Improvements

- Expand to other environments (remote teams, non-profits)
- Include ROI-based prioritization of mitigation
- Add scoring based on FAIR or NIST SP 800-30
