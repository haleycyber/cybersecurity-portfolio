# Insider Threat Awareness & Mitigation Project

This project explores how **insider threats** develop within organizations and provides behavior-based strategies for detection and mitigation. It applies psychological principles (burnout, emotional volatility, job dissatisfaction) to better understand and reduce internal risk.

## 🧠 Why Insider Threats Matter

Insider threats account for over 30% of data breaches and are harder to detect because they:
- Come from **trusted employees**
- Exploit **legitimate access**
- Are often **motivated by emotion** (not money alone)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Raise awareness of behavioral signs of insider risk  
- Map threat scenarios using real-world cases  
- Suggest risk controls informed by psychology and GRC frameworks

---

## 🔍 Behavioral Indicators of Insider Risk

- Increased isolation or secrecy  
- Working unusual hours  
- Disengagement from team or mission  
- Expressing resentment or dissatisfaction  
- Bypassing standard procedures
